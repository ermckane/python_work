'''''You are creating a fantasy video game. The data structure to model the
playerâ€™s inventory will be a dictionary where the keys are string values
describing the item in the inventory and the value is an integer value
detailing how many of that item the player has. For example, the dictionary
value {'rope': 1, 'torch': 6, 'gold coin': 42, 'dagger': 1, 'arrow': 12}
means the player has 1 rope, 6 torches, 42 gold coins, and so on.
Write a function named displayInventory() that'''''
