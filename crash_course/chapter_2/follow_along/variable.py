message = "Hello Python World!"
print(message)

'''
We’ve added a variable named message. Every variable is
connected to a value, which is the information associated with
that variable. In this case the value is the "Hello Python world!" text.
Adding a variable makes a little more work for the
Python interpreter. When it processes the first line, it
associates the variable message with the "Hello Python world!"
text. When it reaches the second line, it prints the value
associated with message to the screen.
Let’s expand on this program by modifying hello_world.py
to print a second message. Add a blank line to
hello_world.py, and then add two new lines of code:
'''

message = "Monty Python is fantastic!"
print(message)
